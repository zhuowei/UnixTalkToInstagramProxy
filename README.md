A proxy to show an Instagram account's recent photos over Unix `talk`.

Inspired by the alt text of https://xkcd.com/1810/, but there's no Instagram DM API, so it views just the public profile.

To try it out, type

`talk justinbieber@boostpower.boosterok.com`

on a Linux or Mac system. If you don't have the Talk utility installed on your system, it's easy to install it: try

`sudo apt install talk`

if you're on Ubuntu.
